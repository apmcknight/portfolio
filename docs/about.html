                <h3>
                    Adam McKnight is an American Designer and Developer,
                    focused on building unique, and intimate experiences.
                    After finding interest in video production, he studied
                    Digital Media at Butler Tech in Hamilton, Ohio.
                    Throughout the program, Adam was introduced to the
                    field of Graphic Design; which ultimately led Him to
                    work at his [former] church as a designer. Adam
                    understood, being a "designer" at the ripe age of
                    18 didn't mean he knew everything. In fact, he
                    wanted to know more; and this longing for more
                    led Him to pursue a Design Degree at Cincinnati State.
                    After taking a Web Development course in his second
                    year, he fell in love with Developmentâ€”both
                    Web &amp; Software.

                    <br> <br> <br>

                    Adam is currently finishing his degree, while freelancing, and searching for a
                    Fulltime Web of Software Engineering job.
