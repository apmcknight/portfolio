            <h3>
                Adam McKnight is a American Designer and Developer,
                focused on building unique, and intimate experiences.
                After finding intrest in video production, he studied Digital Media
                at Butler Tech in Hamilton, Ohio. Through the program, Adam was 
                introduced to the field of Graphic Design; which utamilty led him 
                to work at his [then] church as a designer. Adam understood, being a "designer" at
                the ripe age of 18 didn't mean he knew everything! In fact, he wanted to know more,
                this longing for more led Adam to prusue a Design Degree at Cincinnati State.
                After taking a Web Development course in his second year, he fell in love with Developmentâ€”both Web &amp; software.
                
                <br> <br> <br>
    
                Adam is currently finishing his degree, while freelancing, and searching for a
                Fulltime Web of Software Engineering job.
